      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>The goal for the Dockstore is to bring together tools in Docker containers with a standardized, programmatic
        method of describing how to call them.
        Coupled with registration at Dockstore, this process makes it much easier to use Docker-based tools to build
        larger analytical systems.</p>

      <p>A typical use case for the sciences is to create complex workflows with multiple tools to process large
        datasets.
        We also provide functionality to register, display, and share workflows.</p>

      <p>If you are new to Dockstore, please continue to read or start with our <a routerLink="/onboarding" routerLinkActive="active">tutorial</a></p>
