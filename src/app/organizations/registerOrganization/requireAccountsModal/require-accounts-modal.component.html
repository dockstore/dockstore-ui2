<h1 mat-dialog-title>User Verification</h1>
<p>
  For verification purposes, you are required to have at least two external accounts linked to your Dockstore account. However, it's
  preferrable to have more than two because Dockstore curators will use that information to verify that your organization request is
  legitimate.
</p>
<p>You have {{ numLinkedAccounts }} account(s) linked.</p>
