  <p>
    You are about to launch the {{ term }} <b>{{ path }}</b> in a GitHub Codespace. To configure the Codespace, GitHub reads a dev container
    file from the repository, which specifies the files to use and software to run.
  </p>
  <p *ngIf="!hasDevcontainer">
    <b>No dev container files were detected in this repository.</b> When GitHub can't find a dev container file, it creates a default
    Codespace environment that may not automatically run the {{ term }} or the software required to support it.
  </p>
  <p *ngIf="hasDevcontainer">
    This repository contains dev container files, but Dockstore could not confirm that they will automatically run the {{ term }} when the
    Codespace starts.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the Codespace UI loads, to run the {{ term }},
    <b>you may need to click on the {{ term }} file and select the appropriate menu options to enable the required extensions.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you own the repository, you can create a dev container file that will automatically and run this {{ term }}. Link to documentation.
