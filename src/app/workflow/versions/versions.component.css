- Min-width for table with horizontal scroll
- All columns except name should be as small as possible (assuming content will always fit)
- If content is larger than the min-width, then name should be truncated with ellipsis
- Move some of these classes to scss so that it's easier to apply to all future tables and maintain consistent styling
