<h1 mat-dialog-title>Are you sure you want to delete this Dockstore {{ term }}?</h1>
<div mat-dialog-content>
  <app-alert></app-alert>
  <p>
    You are about to permanently delete the {{ term }} <b>{{ path }}</b
    >. After you delete the {{ term }}, it will no longer appear on Dockstore.
  </p>
  <p>A {{ term }} can be deleted if it:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Has never been published,</li>
    <li>Was created on/after April 1, 2022, and</li>
    <li>Is not a checked or checker workflow.</li>
  </ul>
  <p *ngIf="fromDockstoreYml">
    After you delete the {{ term }}, you must uninstall the Dockstore GitHub App from the source GitHub repo, or edit/remove the
    .dockstore.yml file so that it no longer describes the {{ term }}. If you do not, the {{ term }} may reappear on Dockstore the next time
    you push to the repo.
