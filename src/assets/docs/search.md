# Search

Dockstore now offers facited search, which allows for flexible querying of tools and workflows. Tabs are used to split up the results between tools and workflows. You can search for basic terms/phrases, filter using facets, and also used advanced search queries. Note that using advanced search after setting a basic search will override your basic search, and vice versa.

## Basic Search
If you want to do a basic search for an exact keyword or phrase, use the search box present on the left side of the page. This will search all entries for the exact string you type.

## Advanced search
Advanced search is useful when you want to filter based on words or phrases. It extends basic search by allowing for a combination of Boolean logic. You can access advanced search using the `open advanced search` button shown in the image above.

## Facets
Facets can be used to filter which entries are shown in the search results. For example, you can filter to only shows tools from Quay.io.

## Permalinks
When you filter the search with basic search, advanced search, or facets, a share button will become visible. This button will provide you with a permalink for sharing results with other people. Note that the page number is not yet included in the permalink.

## Tag Cloud
The tag cloud shows a cloud of commonly used tags from all tools and workflows, depending on which tab you are on. It can be helpful for narrowing down your search.
