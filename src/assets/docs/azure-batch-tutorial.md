# Azure Batch

[Azure Batch](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/batch/) has been created to provide a simple way of running containers and simple commands on Azure without you having to closely manage the underlying VM infrastructure (although a knowledge of the underlying infrastructure will always be useful). While Azure Batch does not have an understanding of CWL like a full-on workflow engine, it does provide a very simple way to run a large number of Dockstore tools at scale.
 
Azure Batch also provides a client-side tool called [Batch Shipyard](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard) which provides a number of features including a simple command-line interface for submitting batch jobs. 

Of course, keep in mind that if you have a knowledge of CWL and/or do not need the Dockstore command-line to do file provisioning, you can decompose the underlying command-line invocation for the tool and use that as the command for your jobs, gaining a bit of performance. This tutorial focuses on using cwltool and using the Dockstore command-line to provide an experience that is more akin to running Dockstore or cwltool [on the command-line](/docs/launch#dockstore-cli) out of the box. 

1. Run through Azure Shipyard's [Linux Installation Guide](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/blob/master/docs/01-batch-shipyard-installation.md#step-2a-linux-run-the-installsh-script) and then the [Quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/blob/master/docs/02-batch-shipyard-quickstart.md) guide with one of the sample tools such as Torch-CPU. 
1. With the shipyyard CLI setup, get the md5sum sample recipes from GitHub
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/dockstore/batch_wrapper.git
    $ cd batch_wrapper/azure/
    ```
1. Fill out your `config.json`, `credentials.json`, and `jobs.json` in `config.dockstore.md5sum`. If you have trouble finding your access keys, take a look at this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-account-create-portal#view-batch-account-properties). In `jobs.json` note that we use AWS keys to provision or save the final output files. You will also need to modify the parameter json file `md5sum.s3.json` to reflect the location of your S3 bucket. 
1. Create a compute pool. Note that this pool is not setup to automatically resize. You may also need to pick a larger VM size with a larger dataset. 
    ```
    $ ./shipyard pool add --configdir config.dockstore.md5sum
    ```
1. Submit the job and watch the output (this should take roughly a minute if the pool already exists)
    ```
    $ ./shipyard jobs add --configdir config.dockstore.md5sum --tail stdout.txt

1. You can repeat the process with `config.dockstore.bwa` which is a more realistic bioinformatics workflow from the [PCAWG project](http://icgc.org/working-pancancer-data-aws) and takes roughly seven hours.
