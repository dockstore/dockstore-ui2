# Getting Started with Dockstore

## Linking With External Services

If you have not gone through the onboarding wizard yet, the first step is to [login](https://www.dockstore.org/login) and link your external accounts. You can also get the command line tool we will use for most of the tasks in this tutorial.  For this tutorial you only need to have your GitHub and Quay.io accounts established. However, Dockstore supports the following external services:
* GitHub
* Bitbucket
* GitLab
* Quay.io

Your link to GitHub is established on login and you will then be prompted to link your other accounts.

![Link accounts](../assets/images/docs/linking1.png)

<!-- Currently UI2 does not perform and automatic refresh all tools -->
<!-- Linking a supported image repository service (e.g. Quay.io) will automatically trigger a synchronization order to retrieve information about the account's tools

![Refresh tools](../assets/images/docs/linking2.png) -->

Below, GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab and Quay.io accounts have been linked, it is necessary for at least the GitHub account be linked in order to perform regular account activities.

![Link accounts completed](../assets/images/docs/linking3.png)

Next, the wizard will instruct you to setup the `dockstore` command line tool after linking your accounts, and upon completion you will be ready to use Dockstore.

## Register Your Tool in Dockstore

Now that you have your `Dockerfile` and `Dockstore.cwl` in GitHub, have setup Quay.io to automatically build your Docker image, and have linked your accounts to Dockstore, it is time to register your tool.

### Quick Registration via the Web UI

In the authenticated Web UI, navigate to 'My Tools' to begin managing Docker images imported through your linked account(s). These pages will allow you to quickly register tools that follow a particularly simple format (look below to manual registration for more complex formats). For quick registration, we look through your Quay.io images and see if any are set up as [automated builds](https://docs.quay.io/guides/building.html). Using those to track back to your GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab accounts, we list all pairs of Docker images with git repositories that contain a `Dockstore.cwl` and a `Dockerfile`. When we discover both of these, we create an unpublished entry in the interface below.

![My Tools](../assets/images/docs/register_ui.png)

The left side menu is a list of all image repositories associated with the user, grouped lexicographically by namespace. Each tool is named after the docker location of the associated Docker image, in this example, `quay.io/cancercollaboratory/dockstore-tool-bedgraph-bigwig`. Detailed information and links for each tool are located on the 'Info' tab. The 'Labels' tab allows editing of keywords to be associated with a tool for efficient searching and grouping. Settings such as the path to the Dockerfile and CWL Descriptor can be modified on a per-tag basis in the 'Versions' tab. The Dockerfile, CWL/WDL Descriptor and test parameter files may be viewed in the 'Files' tab, by the Version tag (corresponding to a Git tag/branch).

We also look for `/test.cwl.json` and `/test.wdl.json` in the git repositories on quick registration. These are the default test parameter file locations. Whenever a new version is added, we will check for these default files. You can also change these after quick registration. They will be applied to all versions that have not been edited, as well as any new versions that may appear.

A tool is not visible on the public 'Tools' listing unless it is published. To publish a tool, press the yellow 'Publish' button in the top-right corner.

For the tutorial, generally, you should hit the "Refresh All Tools" button to make sure Dockstore has examined your latest repositories on Quay.  Do this especially if you created a new repository like we did here.

 ![Refresh](../assets/images/docs/dockstore_refresh.png)

Now select the `collaboratory/dockstore-tool-bamstats` repository and click "Publish".  The tool is now listed on Dockstore!

![Publish](../assets/images/docs/publish.png)

You can also click on the "Versions" tab and should notice `1.25-6` is present and valid.  If any versions are invalid it is likely due to a path issue to the `Dockstore.cwl`, `Dockerfile`, or `Dockstore.wdl` (if used) files.  In BAMStats I used the default value of `Dockstore.cwl` and `Dockerfile` in the root repo directory so this was not an issue.

![Publish](../assets/images/docs/versions_toggle.png)

Next, pick a version of your tool that you wish to present to the world by clicking on the radio selector in the Git Reference or Version column. This will determine which version of your CWL/WDL file will be used to find the author, email, and description in the case that it changes between versions. This also allows you to pre-select a version of your tool to present to users in the "Launch With" section, and the Dockerfile and Descriptor tabs.


#### Manual Registration of Tools

Outside of this tutorial, in certain cases, it is not possible for Dockstore to register every existing tool, especially those with unusual project structures. Most notably, Docker Hub and GitLab images can not be automatically detected by Dockstore. The second possibility is that you have multiple CWL documents in a GitHub repository associated with multiple images. For those cases, it is necessary to manually register their details to Dockstore.

Tools can be registered manually from the 'My Tools' page by pressing the 'Add Tool' button at the bottom of the right side bar, or any of the '+' buttons in each accordion namespace group. A modal dialog will appear as below:

![Register Tool Manual](../assets/images/docs/register_container_manual.png)

The Source Code Repository and Image Registry fields must be filled out, they are in the format `namespace/name` (the two paths may differ). The Dockerfile Path,  CWL/WDL Descriptor Paths, and CWL/WDL Test Parameter Paths are relative to the root of the Source Code Repository (and must begin with '/'), these will be the default locations to find their corresponding files, unless specified otherwise in the tags. The toolname is an optional 'suffix' appended to the Dockstore path, it allows for two repositories to share the same Git and Image Registry paths; the combination of Docker image registry path and toolname uniquely distinguishes tools in Dockstore.

If you want to register a private Docker image and manage access, please click the "private" checkbox. You will also be asked for a tool maintainer email. This is the email of the person responsible for giving users access to your tool on external sites. If you do not provide a tool maintainer email, we will use the email found in the tool's CWL descriptor instead.

Upon successful submission and registration of the tool, a resynchronization call will be made to fetch all available data from the given sources. If the image registry is Quay.io, existing version tags will be prepopulated for the Dockstore record.

The user will then be taken to the 'Versions' tab of the new tool, where tags (corresponding to GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab tag names) may be added.

![Versions Grid](../assets/images/docs/version_tags.png)

Press the 'Add Tag' button to begin creating tags for the different versions of the image. The tag creation modal will appear:

![Edit Version Tag Dialogue](../assets/images/docs/tageditor_modal.png)

The fields in the form should correspond to the actual values on GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab and Quay.io/Docker Hub in order for the information to be useful to other users. Selecting `Hidden` will prevent the tag from appearing in the public listing of tags for the image.

### CLI Client

The `dockstore` command line can be used as an alternative to the GUI and has a couple modes.

```
$ dockstore

```


You can then use `dockstore tool publish` to see the list of available Docker images you can register with Dockstore. This is for you to publish tools that are auto-detected from Quay.io. The key is that Docker images you wish to (quick) publish have the following qualities:

0. public
0. at least one valid tag. In order to be valid, a tag has to:
    * be automated from a GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab reference
    * have the reference be linked to the `Dockerfile`
    * have the reference be linked a corresponding `Dockstore.cwl`

```
    $ dockstore tool publish

    $ dockstore tool publish --entry quay.io/cancercollaboratory/dockstore-tool-snpeff

```

You can see in the above, the tool (identified with `quay.io/cancercollaboratory/dockstore-tool-snpeff` in Dockstore and Quay.io) was successfully registered and can be seen by anyone on the Dockstore site.

The `dockstore tool manual_publish` command can be used to manually register a tool on Docker Hub. Its usage is outlined in the publish_manual help menu. This will allow you to register entries that do not follow the qualities above (non-automated builds and Docker Hub images).

```
$ dockstore tool manual_publish --help

HELP FOR DOCKSTORE
------------------
See https://www.dockstore.org for more information

Usage: dockstore tool manual_publish --help

------------------
```

## Sharing the Tool

This is the simple part.  Now that we've successfully registered the tool on Dockstore you can just send around a link, for example to the BAMStat tool I just registered:

https://www.dockstore.org/containers/quay.io/briandoconnor/dockstore-tool-bamstats

## Find Other Tools

You can find tools on the Dockstore website or also through the `dockstore tool search` command line option.

## Next Steps

You can follow this basic pattern for each of your Docker-based tools.  Once registered, you can send links to your tools on Dockstore to colleagues and use it as a public platform for sharing your tools.

Read up on how Dockstore uses Docker registries at the [Docker Registries](/docs/docker_registries) page or see our [full list of documentation](/docs).
