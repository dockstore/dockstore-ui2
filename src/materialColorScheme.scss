// The below is new from Kim's new color scheme: https://app.zeplin.io/project/5fc690a2717ee9144814f190/screen/5fc699d068c46f17551f745b.
// Note: By default, material uses 3 shades of each color (mainly just one). The other shades can be used by manually overriding the default material components.
// The contrast is not specified in Kim's design. It is chosen from either black or white depending on
// what's legible in both normal and large text when using https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=1&primary.color=21335b&secondary.color=487980
// Accent 1 to 4, warning, and border is not covered.
